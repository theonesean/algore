# algore: he cares about the environment

Simple bash-based .env file management.

use: `algore [env file]`     
options: `-h/--help, -v/--version, -l/--list, -c/--current`

If you have a bunch of different .env files for a project, save them as `.env.something`. `algore` will take it from there.

To install: `chmod +x algore.sh && ln -s algore.sh /usr/local/bin/algore`

You might need to `sudo` those commands.
